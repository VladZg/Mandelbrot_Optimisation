# Mandelbrot fractal optimization

![Example 1](Pictures/1.png)

## Introduction
In this work I tried to optimize algorithm of drawing Mandelbrot set by using available on my computer SIMD-instructions: AVX2 and AVX512.

...

As we see, perfomance of algorithm depends on amount of pixels in resulting picture

``t ~ width * height``

Number of operating pixels in algorithm is ``640*560 = 358400``. It actually takes time to process all of them, so algorithm optimization required.

## Optimization principles
Ideas of optimization that use AVX2 and AVX512 instructions are the same.

We are able to process 8 pixels at the same time by using __m256i variables and AVX2 instructions or 16 pixels by using __m512i variables and AVX512 instructions. Here is mechanism of optimization described step-by-step.

## Perfomance
To evaluate and compare the speed of working algorithms I calculate fps value of 10 cycles of Alpha-Blending.

``fps = 1 / blending_time``

It's important to evaluate the time correctly, so when I do it, app don't draw anything in SFML, just operates with arrays of pixels

Evaluations made with precision ~ ``0.3 sec^(-1)``

|optimization \ flag|None   |-O0 |-O1 |-O2 |-O3     |-Ofast|
|:------------------|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:------:|:----:|
|no AVX inctructions|**2.5**|2.5 |4.3 |4.6 |4.6     |4.7   |
|                   |       |    |    |    |        |      |
|AVX2 inctructions  |7.4    |7.3 |27.3|27.4|**27.6**|27.6  |
|speed increase     |3.0    |2.5 |6.3 |6.0 |6.0     |5.9   |
|                   |       |    |    |    |        |      |
|AVX512 inctructions|       |    |    |    |        |      |
|speed increase     |       |    |    |    |        |      |

In the table speed increase calculated by formula
``speed_increase = (optimization_time / no_optimization_time)`` ,
where times are taken with the same set of flags

Max speedup is **147,0/9.1 = 16.2**

## Conclusion
Thus, optimizing Mandelbrot set drawing algorithm by using AVX2 instructions, a speedup of **27.6/4.6 = 6.0** times was achieved
