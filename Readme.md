# Optimization of drawing Mandelbrot set

![Example 1](Pictures/1.png)

## Introduction
In this work I tried different ways to speed up the Mandelbrot set calculation algorithm. For that purpose I used available on my computer SIMD-instructions: SSE, AVX2 and AVX512.

**Goals**: 
- achieve maximum speedup of the program using SIMD instructions
- measure and compare them
- evaluate influence of compilation flags on the speed of the programm

## Algorithm of drawing

The Mandelbrot set is a good example of the beauty of mathematics, and there is a simple algorithm to construct it.



As we see, perfomance of algorithm depends on amount of pixels in resulting picture

``t ~ width * height``

Number of operating pixels in algorithm is ``640*560 = 358400``. It actually takes time to process all of them, so algorithm optimization required.

## Optimization principles
Ideas of optimization that use AVX2 and AVX512 instructions are the same.

We are able to process 8 pixels at the same time by using __m256i variables and AVX2 instructions or 16 pixels by using __m512i variables and AVX512 instructions. Here is mechanism of optimization described step-by-step.

## Time measuring principles
To evaluate and compare the speed of working algorithms I calculate fps value of 10 cycles of Alpha-Blending.

``fps = 1 / blending_time``

It's important to evaluate the time correctly, so when I do it, app don't draw anything in SFML, just operates with arrays of pixels

Evaluations made with precision ~ ``0.3 sec^(-1)``

## Perfomance
Running programms with different optimization flags and evaluating their perfomances gave me data for the following table

|optimization \ flag|None    |-O0 |-O1 |-O2  |-O3      |-Ofast   |
|:------------------|:------:|:--:|:--:|:--: |:-------:|:-------:|
|no AVX inctructions|**2.5** |2.5 |4.5 |4.5  |4.6      |4.8      |
|                   |        |    |    |     |         |         |
|SSE inctructions   |**4.1** |4.1 |16.9|162.7|**163.1**|163.0    |
|abs speed increase |**1.6** |1.6 |3.8 |36.2 |35.5     |34.0     |
|                   |        |    |    |     |         |         |
|AVX2 inctructions  |**8.3** |8.3 |29.5|157.1|157.1    |156.9    |
|abs speed increase |**3.3** |3.3 |6.6 |34.9 |34.2     |32.7     |
|rel speed increase |**2.1** |2.1 |1.7 |~1.0 |~1.0     |~1.0     |
|                   |        |    |    |     |         |         |
|AVX512 inctructions|**14.2**|14.2|44.2|155.1|156.2    |155.2    |
|abs speed increase |**5.7** |5.7 |9.8 |34.5 |34.0     |32.3     |
|rel speed increase |**1.7** |1.7 |1.5 |~1.0 |~1.0     |~1.0     |

In the table programm speed is given in fps (1/sec).

To compare SIMD-instructions with each other and evaluate an impact of optimization flags I calculated 2 differernt —Åoefficients of speed increase:
- abs_speed_increase = instruction_working_time/no_instruction_working_time, where time periods are taken from the perfomances with the same flags set
- rel_speed_increase = instruction_working_time/prev_instruction_working_time, where time periods are also taken from the perfomances with the same flags set

The absolute coefficient factor are used to compare a program with and without an AVX or SSE instruction. The relative coefficient are used to compare SSE, AVX2 and AVX512 instructions with each other.



``speed_increase = (optimization_time / no_optimization_time)`` ,
where times are taken with the same set of flags

Max speedup is **147,0/9.1 = 16.2**

## Conclusion
Thus, optimizing Mandelbrot set drawing algorithm by using AVX2 instructions, a speedup of **27.6/4.6 = 6.0** times was achieved
